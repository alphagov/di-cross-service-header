# Changelog

- Follow the guidelines on semver.org for assigning version numbers.
- Mark breaking changes with `BREAKING:`. Be sure to include instructions on how applications should be upgraded.
- Include a link to your pull request.
- Don't include changes that are purely internal. The CHANGELOG should be a
  useful summary for people upgrading their application, not a replication
  of the commit log.
